"chart_mdata" --> the count proceeds per charter. I.e., one entry = one charter.
id, cont, sub_cont, coll, rep, orig, authen, compl, issue_aut, issue_scr, issue_date, f_agent

char_id = charter database identification number = individual number that identifies a specific charter within the database created.
The id is composed of the ISO 3166 country Alpha-2 code and the entry number in the database. The country
code follows the CHLA division based on collection. E.g., IT1 is the id for the first Italian charter entered in the
database.
  Type() = string
cont = context = case study context taken into consideration. Options: regnum italiae | bavaria
  Type() = string
sub_cont = sub-context = case study context taken into consideration. Options: piacenza | lucca | freising
  Type() = string
coll = collection = the original collection the item was part of.
  Type() = string
rep = repository = the collection, volume or book from which the charter has been analyzed for this study.
  Type() = string
orig = original = defines whether the charter is original or a copy.
  Type() = Boolean ### might want to change it to string, in case some of the charters might be a mix of original & copy
forg = forgery = defines whether the charter is a forgery or authentic. Options: authentic | forgery | mix
  Type() = string
  ###alternative: type() = int with a scale 0 | 1 | 2 arbitrarily assigned instead of authentic | forgery | mix
issue_aut = issuing authority = authority invoked by the scribe in issuing the charters
  Type () = string
issue_scr = issuing scribe = the person drafting the document. It can include name, title or both
  Type() = string
issue_date = issuing date = the date in which the document was drafted. This is replicated verbatim from the document
in case the date in standard ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD or its truncated and/or incomplete forms) is not recoverable.
  Type() = string
  ##alternative: use datetime
f_agent = identifies whether the charter mentions at least one female-sexed legal agent. This includes
groups of female agents (e.g., female religious institutions). The sexing of the agent
is based on the morphology of the name taken into consideration. This variable is not determined by the gender of the agent, but by its grammatical sexing.In cases where the attribution was unclear from the name and collateral factors, male | female was maintained. Options: male | female | (male | female)
  Type () = string
  ###might want to change this to an integer on a scale 0 | 1 | 2 (0 = female sexing, 1 = undecisive, 2 = male sexing)
