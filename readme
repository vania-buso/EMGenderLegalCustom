'READ ME' FILE FOR 'GENDER AND LEGAL CUSTOM DATABASE'

************
PROJECT INFORMATION
************
This relational database comprises of metadata relevant to the study of gender in Carolingian
legal custom. All the data is taken from charters contained in the CHLA which date between 8th
and 9th century (included). The database is organized in individual datasets created in tabular form
(with .csv file extension) according of the principle of Tidy Data, so that each sheet contains
 a single observational unit. All the individual datasets are computationally tractable. The review
 and analysis of this database, the datasets and the data itself should be mingled with the reading
 of the doctoral dissertation by the same author. Any other way of using this material should be
 considered a misuse.

METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION
****************************

1. Data collection: detailed explanation about the methods and principled followed during data collection
can be found in the doctoral dissertation that accompanies this database.

2. Data processing methods: detailed explanation about this process can be found in the
doctoral dissertation that accompanies this database.

3. Instrument information: all the data was cleaned with OpenRefine once it had been compiled in .csv files.
Preliminary visual analysis was performed through the built-in tools in nodegoat.net and Data Wrapper (URL:).
In depth EDA and visualization were performed in R 1.4.1. and Python 3.9.6. At no stage, after
the creation of the .csv files, were the files processed with tools that might have altered their formatting (e.g., Excel).

4. Quality assurance procedures: At no stage, after the creation of the .csv files, were the files
processed with tools that might have altered their formatting (e.g., Excel).

5. Analysis methods: EDA methods were adapted from: Arnold, Taylor and Tilton, Lauren. "Humanities Data in R: Exploring
Networks, Geospatial Data, Images, and Text." Springer, 2015.
