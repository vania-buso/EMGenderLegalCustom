"agents" --> the count proceeds per transaction's role, i.e., there might be multiple entries with the same agent_id

agent_id, trans_id, char_id, name, gramm_sex, role, co_agency, akin_to, patron, attributes, signature

agent_id = agent database identification number = identifies a specific legal agent within the database created.
The id is composed of the letter I(for individual)/G(for group/institution) + the number of entry in the database + "_[sub_cont]".
E.g., i1_lucca is the first individual legal agent entry for Lucca.
  Type () = string

trans_id = transaction database identification number = identifies a specific legal transaction within the database created.
The id is composed of the char_id in which the transaction is mentioned + the entry number of the transaction in the database. The database counts the number of transactions, not the number of mentions of a transaction.
  Type() = string

char_id =  charter database identification number = individual number that identifies a specific charter within the database created.
The id is composed of the ISO 3166 country Alpha-2 code and the entry number in the database. The country
code follows the CHLA division based on collection. E.g., IT1 is the id for the first Italian charter entered in the
database.
  Type() = string

name = name of the agent, as it appears in the charter. 
  Type() = string
  
name_norm = name of the agent, normalized according to [select lexicon/ dictionary]. The normalization was introduced in order to allow comparisons. 
  Type() = string

gramm_sex = grammatical sex = grammatical sex attributed on the basis of the morphology of the name in Latin. In cases where the attribution was unclear from the name and collateral factors, male | female was maintained. Options: male | female | (male | female)
  Type () = string

role = role = role that the legal agent takes up in the transaction alone or as part of a group. Options: witness | seller | buyer | exchanger | confirmer | benefactor | [...]. Details about the definition of each of these categories can be found in the appendix to the thesis "Legal agency roles"
  Type () = string

co_agency = co-agency = indicates whether an individual is acting together with someone else. In order for a co-agency to be categorized as such, the text must offer expressions such as "in accordance with", "alongside (cum)" etc. The verb can appear in the singular form or in the plural. For group agents, this variable takes the value 0 to define "not applicable".
  Type () = Boolean

consent = legal agency consented by = indicates whether there is an indication in the charter that the agent's authority derives from a third party. This can be an unidentified individual (U) a family member (FM), a political actor (PA), a clergyman (C) or any combination of these. This variable takes value NA if it's not applicable.
  Type () = string

attributes = attributes of the agent = reports verbatim as a list of items [] the attributes of the agent in Latin. The Latin is normalized in order to offer meaningful comparisons with the rest of the data.
  Type () = string

signature = signature of the agent = indicates whether the agent is signing the document and what evidence is available for such claims. In case the document is a copy, this variable takes value 0 to define "not applicable". Options: signer | autographer | (signer | autographer) | not_signer.
  Type () = string
 
 subscribing = scribe's subscription = indicates wehther the scribe declares his subscription in the charter
   Type() = Boolean

m_trans = multiple transactions = indicates whether the agent is implied in different transactions, whether in the same role or in different roles. This variable consistutes of a guess made on the basis of chronological and geographical consistency. In case an agent is deemed to be involved in various transactions, this variable reports a list of items [] with the trans_id of the relevant transactions. In case they are not, this variable takes the value NA to define "missing data", for we cannot be sure whether the agent took part in transactions whose records might have been lost for random reasons. This is however a case of MAR (Missing At Random) rather than MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) because there might have also been systematic reasons why an agent was not given legal agency in more than one transaction.
  Type () = string
